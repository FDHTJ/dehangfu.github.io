Hello, my name is Dehang Fu (ä»˜å¾·èˆª). I am currently a final-year student at the [Central University of Finance and Economics](https://www.cufe.edu.cn) majoring Computer Science, and I come from Heze, a city in Shandong province, China. Currently focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs), software engineering, and data mining.
I am familiar with common algorithms (see my [LeetCode profile](https://leetcode.cn/u/vigorous-yonathiev/)) and proficient in using PyTorch for deep learning experiments. I have hands-on experience training LLMs with over 10B parameters using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.
In addition, I am skilled in web development with Vue and Spring Boot, and have prior Android development experience. One example of my web project is the [Information Retrieval System](https://github.com/FDHTJ/information_retrieval_system).
